**EVM Wallet Registration for Plume Project Airdrop** (https://registration.plumenetwork.xyz/)

Channel: https://t.me/shrimp_to_whale

**MAIN INFO**
- **Row-by-Row Data Processing**: Each line in `Privated.txt` ALWAYS corresponds to the same line in `Proxies.txt` (e.g., line 1 in `Privates.txt` matches line 1 in `Proxies.txt`, line 5 matches line 5, and so on).
- **Proxy Region Handling**: If the location of your proxies is identified as a restricted region for receiving the airdrop, the software will continue registering the account using a local IP address (with a corresponding warning logged).
- **Results Logging**: Upon completion, all successful or failed accounts (addresses) will be saved to the project directory in `Success_accs.txt` and `Failed_accs.txt`, respectively.


**Files that need to be filled out**

`Privates.txt` - Private keys of your accounts.
`Proxies.txt` - proxies in the format api:port:login:password format.
